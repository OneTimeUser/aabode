# Aabode
Aabode is an Algorand-based end-to-end suite of mortgage origination, investing and real estate transaction tools that serve the housing market of the future.

Aabode plans to create and release the following tools:
1. Affinity: a deed creation and recording tool
2. Attach√©: a storage wallet for active/past deeds and associated contracts
3. Ascent: a tool for integrating with legacy systems to bring off-chain stored documents on-chain. 

Additionally, we aim to document our workflow and experiences here in order to help others work with institutions like governements and non-profits to enumerate the advantages that blockchain technology affords while aid in on-chain conversion.
